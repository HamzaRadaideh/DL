# Keras API Project Exercise

## Overview

This project utilizes a subset of the LendingClub dataset to build a model that predicts whether a borrower will repay their loan. The dataset includes various features related to the borrower's financial history, loan details, and personal information.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the LendingClub data, which contains historical loan data with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off). The goal is to predict loan repayment status based on the features provided.

## Data Source

The data can be obtained from Kaggle: [LendingClub DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club)

## Project Goals

Given historical data on loans with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted, the goal is to build a model that can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan. This allows for the assessment of new potential customers and their likelihood to repay the loan.
